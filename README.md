# Finding Donors for Charity
A Supervised Machine Learning project using Scikit Learn to predict donors for a charity organization.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT
In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of
your choice to accurately model individuals’ income using data
collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the
best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further
optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this
implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts
whether an individual makes more than $50,000.This sort of task
can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on
donations. Understanding an individual’s income can help a nonprofit better understand how large of a donation to request, or
whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be
difficult to determine an individual’s general income bracket
directly from public sources, we can infer this value from other
publically available features.

In this project, we will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) to identify people most likely to donate to their cause. We will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded and then will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. We will then evaluate several supervised learners of choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, we will optimize the selected model and present it as the solution to CharityML. Finally, we will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn (v0.17)
- matplotlib

## DATA VISUALIZATION
By running the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries
and load
the census data.By targeting the dataset “income”(whether an
individual
makes more than ,or at most,50K annually). All other columns are
features about each individual in the census database.
